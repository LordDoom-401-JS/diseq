\title{Equilibrium model estimated using 2-stage least squares.}
\description{
In the first stage, prices are regressed on remaining controls from both the
demand and supply equations. In the second stage, the demand and supply equation is estimated
using the fitted prices instead of the observed. A necessary identification condition is that
there is at least one control that is exclusively part of the demand and one control
that is exclusively part of the supply equation.
