\title{Disequilibrium model with stochastic price dynamics.}
\description{
The disequilibrium model with stochastic price adjustment is described by a
system of four equations. Three of of them form a stochastic linear system of market equations
equations coupled with a stochastic price evolution equation. The fourth equation is the short
side rule. In contrast to the deterministic counterpart, the model does not impose any
separation rule on the sample. It is estimated using full information maximum likelihood.
